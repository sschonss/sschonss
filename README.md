Back-end developer with a professional background in PHP and Laravel. In addition to my expertise in these technologies, I have been dedicating my studies to Go and Elixir to further enrich my skillset. As a student of Tecnologia em Sistemas para Internet at the Federal Technological University of Paran√°, I am deeply passionate about learning and sharing knowledge. I actively maintain a Medium profile where I write articles on various topics related to my studies. Furthermore, I have been studying English for 5 years and have reached an advanced level after completing a 200-hour course at Excellent Global School. Continuous learning is something I value greatly.
