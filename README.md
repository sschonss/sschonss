I am a Senior Software Architect with extensive experience in backend development, specializing in PHP frameworks such as Laravel and Hyperf. My expertise lies in software architecture and building scalable, high-performance applications with a strong focus on Developer Experience. I design and evolve modern architectures including well-structured monoliths, microservices, and event-driven systems, always striving for a balance between performance, simplicity, and cost. I have hands-on experience in high-scale environments with over 100k users, legacy modernization, cloud cost optimization, robust API design, event-driven architectures, technical debt management, and advocating best engineering practices. As a tech community enthusiast, I organize events at DevParan√° and actively share knowledge to strengthen the local ecosystem.
