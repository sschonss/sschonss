Back-end developer with extensive experience in PHP, specializing in frameworks like Hyperf and Laravel, alongside deep knowledge of modern technologies for building scalable and high-performance applications. I possess strong expertise in software architecture, rigorously applying principles such as SOLID, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and Clean Architecture to create robust and well-structured systems.

Throughout my career, I have gained significant experience in designing RESTful APIs, integrating distributed systems, and working with containerized environments using Docker and Docker Compose. I also have practical expertise in relational and non-relational databases, focusing on performance optimization and scalability. My technical approach is grounded in automated testing and best development practices, ensuring high-quality and reliable code.

Additionally, I am an active member of the tech community, organizing events for Dev Paran√° in Guarapuava, PR, and contributing to the growth and strengthening of the local development ecosystem.
